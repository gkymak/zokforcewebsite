This enhanced recommendation logic provides:

## 🎯 **Key Features:**

**1. Question-Level Granularity:**
- Individual recommendations for each of 72 questions
- Score-specific action plans (1-4 levels)
- Targeted improvement strategies

**2. Intelligent Prioritization:**
- **CRITICAL** (Score 1): Immediate action, high risk
- **HIGH** (Score 2): Short-term focus, medium-high risk  
- **MEDIUM** (Score 3): Medium-term optimization
- **LOW** (Score 4): Long-term innovation

**3. Detailed Action Plans:**
- Specific, actionable recommendations
- Expected outcomes and success metrics
- Resource requirements and timelines
- Regulatory alignment context

**4. Risk-Based Analysis:**
- Individual risk contribution scoring
- Overall organizational risk assessment
- Compliance gap identification
- Quick wins identification

**5. Professional Presentation:**
- Priority-based categorization
- Resource requirement estimation
- Budget planning support
- Timeline-based implementation roadmap

This approach transforms generic pillar recommendations into precise, actionable guidance based on exactly where the organization stands on each specific AI ethics dimension.
